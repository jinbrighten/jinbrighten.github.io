## ABSTRACT

Multi-user augmented reality (AR), where multiple co-located users view a common set of virtual objects, is becoming increasingly popular. For example, Google Just a Line allows multiple users to draw virtual graffiti in the same physical space. Multi-user AR requires network communications in order to coordinate the positions of the virtual objects on each user's display, yet there is currently little understanding of how such apps communicate. In this work, we address this key gap in knowledge by showing that the communicated data directly impacts the latency and positioning of the virtual objects rendered on the users' displays. We develop solutions to these problems that we find along three facets: (1) efficient communication strategies that trade off communication latency for spatial consistency of the virtual objects; (2) a new metric that enables mobile AR devices to update their virtual objects as they move around and observe more of the scene; and (3) a tool to automatically quantify how much the virtual objects' positions inadvertently change in time and space. Our evaluation is performed on Android smartphones running open-source AR. The results show that our system, SPAR, can decrease the latency by up to 55%, while decreasing the spatial inconsistency by up to 60%, compared to baseline methods.
